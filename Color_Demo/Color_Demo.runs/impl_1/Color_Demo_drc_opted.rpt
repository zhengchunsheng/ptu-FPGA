2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Camera_IIC_SDA_IOBUF/IBUF (in Camera_IIC_SDA_IOBUF macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT Driver_IIC0/FSM_sequential_Write_State[6]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 10 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
Diver_OV5647_Init/Enable_reg, Diver_OV5647_Init/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[0], Diver_OV5647_Init/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[1], Diver_OV5647_Init/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[2], Diver_OV5647_Init/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[3], Diver_OV5647_Init/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[4], Diver_OV5647_Init/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[5], Diver_OV5647_Init/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[6], Diver_OV5647_Init/Reg_Addr_reg, Diver_OV5647_Init/Reg_Data_reg
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1580#1 Warning
Phase alignment  
Unsupported clocking topology used for OSERDESE2 rgb2dvi/U0/ClockSerializer/SerializerMaster. This can result in corrupted data. The rgb2dvi/U0/ClockSerializer/SerializerMaster/CLK / rgb2dvi/U0/ClockSerializer/SerializerMaster/CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship. Please refer to the Select I/O User Guide for supported clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1580#2 Warning
Phase alignment  
Unsupported clocking topology used for OSERDESE2 rgb2dvi/U0/ClockSerializer/SerializerSlave. This can result in corrupted data. The rgb2dvi/U0/ClockSerializer/SerializerSlave/CLK / rgb2dvi/U0/ClockSerializer/SerializerSlave/CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship. Please refer to the Select I/O User Guide for supported clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1580#3 Warning
Phase alignment
